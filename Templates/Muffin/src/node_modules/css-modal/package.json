JavaScript is only\nfor sugar. This makes them perfectly accessible.\n\n__Optimized for mobile:__ The modals are designed using responsive web design\nmethods. They work on all screen sizes from a small mobile phone up to high\nresolution screens.\n\n__Use as Sass plugin:__ You can use CSS Modal as [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)\nplugin and apply it to your custom classes. No need to understand all the code.\n\n__A few other advantages:__ accessible, cross-browser, media-adaptive, small and\nfast!\n\n\n## How to use\n\n### Markup\n\nYou need to include the markup and content for modals in you website. This has\na positive effect on SEO. The example code:\n\n\t<section class=\"semantic-content\" id=\"modal-text\" tabindex=\"-1\"\n\t        role=\"dialog\" aria-labelledby=\"modal-label\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n\n\t    <div class=\"modal-inner\">\n\t        <header id=\"modal-label\"><!-- Header --></header>\n\t        <div class=\"modal-content\"><!-- The modals content --></div>\n\t        <footer><!-- Footer --></footer>\n\t    </div>\n\n\t    <a href=\"#!\" class=\"modal-close\" title=\"Close this modal\" data-close=\"Close\"\n\t        data-dismiss=\"modal\">×</a>\n\t</section>\n\nUsing header and footer is optional. Just remove the tags if you don't want them\nin a modal.\n\nYou should leave the link's href attribute that way to close the modal in order\nto prevent the page from scrolling to top when clicking on it.\n\nPlease remember to set a unique ID for the header and change the\n`aria-labelledby` attribute to the same value.\n\n### Sass\n\nIf you use Sass you can use the file [modal.scss](modal.scss) and include it\ninto your project. Here is an example:\n\n\t@import \"modules/modal\";\n\nCSS Modals uses Sass's placeholders. You can use them by calling them via\n@extend in your modal's class name. The snippet looks something like that:\n\n\t.my-awesome-class-name {\n\t    @extend %modal;\n\t}\n\n### JavaScript\n\nAs stated above you don't need JavaScript to get a good experience out of CSS\nModals. But there are some issues where JavaScript helps:\n\n* IE 8 compatibility.\n* Pressing escape: If you press ESC on your keyboard while the modal is visible\nit closes itself. This behavior cannot be done with CSS only.\n* Preventing background page from scrolling: If you scroll within the modal and\nyou reach the end you don't want the page in the background to scroll. To prevent\nthis JavaScript pushs a CSS class selector to the body element.\n* Being accessible: To get the browser's focus to the modal and back after\nclosing.\n* Fireing events: When a modal opens a custom event is fired called cssmodal:show.\nWhen the modal is hidden, an event called cssmodal:hide is triggered.\n* To add this behavior to your website, please include the JavaScript file\nmodal.js right before the closing body-tag:\n\n\t<script src=\"js/modal.js\"></script>\n\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThis modal is designed to work on all modern browsers. Unfortunately this does\nnot include Internet Explorer 7 or lower. But we deal with IE 8 – well,… at\nleast it works.\n\nOn mobile Safari for iOS and Android 4+ it is tested pretty well, while Android\n2.3 has some problems (biggest issue\n[is scrolling](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/issues/4)).\nIt's also working on Windows Phone 8.\n\nIn numbers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari 6, Opera 12, IE8 (functional), IE9+. And\niOS 6, Android 2.3+.\n\n\n## Media\n\nPlease be aware that you need to stop playing videos or audio manually after\nhiding the modal. We have [a plugin](plugins/html5video.js) for this though.\n\n## Events\n\nThere is an event `cssmodal:show` fired on the modal itself after the modal is\nshown. Another event `cssmodal:hide` is fired after the modal is hidden.\n\nYou can use the events by subscribing to them as if they were click events or\nsomething. Here is an example using jQuery:\n\n\t$(document).on('cssmodal:show', function (event) {\n\t\tconsole.log(event);\n\t});\n\nThere events are not fired in IE8. Please be aware of that and use jQuery or\nsomething else to create custom events.\n\n\n## Bug reports and feature requests\n\nIf you got something that's worth including into the project please\n[open an issue](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/issues) for further\ndiscussion.\n\nPlease see the [section on contributing](http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/#contributing)\non the website.\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis is a project by [Hans Christian Reinl](http://drublic.de). Thanks goes out\nto [all other contributors](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/contributors).\n\n\n[![Bitdeli Badge](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/drublic/css-modal/trend.png)](https://bitdeli.com/free \"Bitdeli Badge\")\n\n",
